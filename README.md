### Topic ###

The topic is airplane delay, are this is a dataset that is displays the airline and if they were delayed and how long it took for the delay.

The reason for this topic is because the airline can check if there is a delay or not.

The source of the data is from counting the time from the time of flight to time of actual departure, from that time and length at which it takes there could be a delay or not.
 
 The question that the data helps answer is if there will be a delay on my flight? With machine learn and the half a million cases we can check if a flight is going to be delayed before hand.
