# Airlines Delay Analysis

### WHY WE SELECTED THIS TOPIC

COVID-19 once stalled much of airline businesses as travel became scarce. In recent months, especially since it has become warm and people are going on summer holidays, airline travel has resumed. However, we've noticed that there are more and more delays in flights that often mess up people's schedules. We are curious to know in more detail which airlines have more delays, which airports, and which flights (origin - destination) are causing more of the delay data. 

### OUR DATA SOURCE

We found an airline dataset with 539383 instances and 8 different features on Kaggle and thought it was a good dataset to utilize for our analysis. It includes location, whether the flight was delayed or not, airline, time/date, etc.

### WHAT WE HOPE TO FIND WITH THE ANALYSIS

We hope to be able to predict whether a flight will have a delay or not.

### DASHBOARD

###### STORYBOARD

###### TOOLS THAT WILL BE USEFUL TO CREATE THE FINAL DASHBOARD

- Tableau
- Machine Learning model

###### DESCRIPTION OF INTERACTIVE ELEMENT

There will be two to three main components to the ***Dashboard***, 
- An interactive map of the U.S. where data points/analysis will show when user hovers over certain locations (and when user clicks into the state, they will be shown to a new page(?) of more details and probability of flight delay
- Percentages and table rankings of different metrics that is live and connected to the ML model (i.e. "top airports with most delays", "worst airlines to fly on based on delays within last x days", etc.)
