## Selected Topic

***Airline Delay***

## Reason
COVID-19 once stalled much of airline businesses as travel became scarce. In recent months, especially since it has become warm and people are going on summer holidays, airline travel has resumed. However, we've noticed that there are more and more delays in flights that often mess up people's schedules. We are curious to know in more detail which airlines have more delays, which airports, and which flights (origin - destination) are causing more of the delay data.

## Description of the source of data
Airlines dataset has 539383 instances and 8 different features. 

Columns include: 
- I. Airline 
- II. Flight 
- III. Airport From 
- IV. Airport To 
- V. DayOfWeek 
- VI. Time
- VII. ID
- VIII. Length 
- IX. Delay

## Questions hope to answer with the data
The goal of this project is to build a flight delay prediction model that predicts whether a given flight will be delayed depending on factors such as: 

- Airline
- Airport
- Day of Week 

## Machine Learning Model
